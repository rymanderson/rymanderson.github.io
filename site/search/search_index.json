An interactive GUI is available at http://droneecon.com. This README will explain general usage as well as the underlying theory for the models used, as currently implemented. Note that Drone-AWE is a work in progress (see Future Work ). This document will explain general usage for the latter, as well as the engineering theory at work behind the scenes. Installation Drone-AWE may be used in two ways: using the GUI available at http://droneecon.com, or by using the source code directly. To use the source code directly, install using pip install drone_awe Usage Basic Usage Base functionality is achieved by running the following: import drone_awe m = drone_awe.model(args) m.simulate() where args is a dictionary containing simulation parameters. Note that for every parameter not specified in args , a default value is used. It is possible to run the default simulation by passing an empty dictionary into the drone_awe.model() method: import drone_awe m = drone_awe.model({}) m.simulate() Settable dictionary keys with example values for args include the following: { \"validation\":False, \"validationcase\":\"DiFranco2016\", \"dronename\":\"dji-Mavic2\", \"batterytechnology\":\"near-future\", \"stateofhealth\":90.0, \"startstateofcharge\":100.0, \"rain\":False, \"dropsize\":1.0, \"liquidwatercontent\":1.0, \"temperature\":15.0, \"wind\":False, \"windspeed\":10.0, \"winddirection\":0.0, \"relativehumidity\":0.0, \"mission\": { \"missionspeed\": 10.0, \"altitude\":100.0, \"heading\":0.0, \"payload:0.0 }, \"timestep\":1, \"plot\":True, \"xlabel\":\"missionspeed\", \"ylabel\":\"power\", \"title\":\"First_test\", \"simulationtype\":\"simple\", \"model\":\"abdilla\", \"xvals\":[0,1,2,3,4,5], \"weathereffect\":\"temperature\", \"weathervals\":[10,20,30,40] } These are explained further in Settings . After a drone_awe.model object is instantiated, settings can be changed by modifying the input class variable as: m.input['xlabel'] = 'payload' m.input['validationcase'] = 'Stolaroff2018' The simulation must then be re-run using: m.simulate() Plotting An optional boolean may be set to produce a plot on runtime by running: m = drone_awe.model({},plot=True) when a drone_awe.model is instantiated. Alternatively, the drone_awe.model 's plot variable may be set at any time: m.plot = True Settings The following subsections explain the use of various settings of a drone_awe.model object. 'dronename' 'dronename' must be set to a string that is defined in the drone database. To access a dictionary containing all supported drones, use the following methods: droneDictionary = drone_awe.drones If a drone or validation case does not exist in the drone database, it may still be used by setting a custom dictionary: m.drone = droneDictionary where droneDictionary is a dictionary with the same keys as the following: { 'id': 'dji-Mavic2', 'wingtype': 'rotary', 'diagonal': 0.354, 'takeoffweight': 0.907, 'speedmax': 20, 'altitudemax': 6000, 'endurancemax': 31, 'endurancemaxspeed': 6.944, 'endurancemaxhover': 29, 'rangemax': 18000, 'rangemaxspeed': 13.889, 'temperaturemin': -10, 'chargerpowerrating': 60, 'batterytype': 'LiPo', 'batterycapacity': 3850, 'batteryvoltage': 15.4, 'batterycells': 4, 'batteryenergy': 59.29, 'batterymass': 0.297, 'waterproof': 'no', 'windspeedmax': 10.8, 'batteryrechargetime': 90, 'rotorquantity': 4, 'rotordiameter': 0.2, 'cruisespeed': 6.94, 'payload': 0.0, 'length': 0.322, 'width': 0.242, 'height': 0.084 } Note that not all parameters need be specified, but if a simulation is run that requires unspecified parameters, the model will not run. 'validation' and 'validationcase' To view validation cases for drone_awe models, set 'validation'=True and 'validationcase' to a string contained in the validation case database. To access a dictionary containing all supported validation cases, run the following: validationDictionary = drone_awe.validationdata() Additionally, validationCaseDictionary is a dictionary with the following format: { 'id': 'Stolaroff2018', 'xvalid': [1.358974359,1.7179487179,1.6923076923,1.7692307692,1.7692307692,1.8205128205,1.8717948718,1.8974358974,1.9230769231,1.9743589744,2.0512820513,2.1025641026,2.1025641026,2.1794871795,2.2820512821,2.3076923077,2.3333333333,2.4358974359,2.5384615385,2.5384615385,2.6666666667,2.7948717949,2.9487179487,3.1025641026,3.2564102564,3.358974359,3.4615384615,3.641025641,3.7435897436,3.8717948718,4.0512820513,4.2564102564,4.358974359,4.641025641,4.8974358974,5.8461538462,6,6.2820512821,6.5384615385,7.1538461538,7.4871794872,7.8205128205,8.4871794872,9.1794871795,9.7692307692,10.2564102564,10.6923076923,11.1282051282,11.5897435897], 'yvalid': [133.7510729614,149.2375075128,142.6477385276,144.5897859156,140.9450186657,141.7583868756,142.3874173587,140.4340604922,139.3656195241,139.5335348046,140.2321151941,139.9589946754,136.1689649626,138.3618186589,141.3711557508,139.4001574523,136.7492021569,136.5131929807,137.712167001,133.136399421,135.7755034665,136.58240428,141.8694500174,143.7278953027,145.8751386173,144.4503136349,143.5492800366,144.4966689523,140.8944307591,139.7885398414,140.0842115956,140.6905892611,140.7593265104,140.4412051028,148.3297356325,161.0751453894,160.7738527567,158.8079335653,157.0439596719,161.2248774665,165.1381601781,164.7032531681,177.1408013138,175.6982333173,190.095233258,197.4485952036,209.0736216573,203.7684942987,215.7551870381], 'drone': { 'validationcase':'Stolaroff2018', 'wingtype': 'rotary', 'rotorquantity': 4, 'takeoffweight': 1.3, 'batterytype': 'LiPo', 'batteryvoltage': 11.1, 'batterymass': 0.262, 'props': '10x4.7', 'endurancemaxhover': 16, 'payloadmax': 0.4, 'batterycapacity': 5500, 'payload': 0.0, 'rotordiameter': 0.254, 'batterycells': 3, 'length': 0.280, 'width': 0.140, 'height': 0.100, 'waterproof': 'no' }, 'settings': { 'dronename': 'drone', 'stateofhealth': 100.0, 'startstateofcharge': 100.0, 'altitude': 100.0, 'temperaturesealevel': 15.0, 'rain': False, 'dropsize': 0.0, 'liquidwatercontent': 1.0, 'temperature': 15.0, 'wind': False, 'windspeed': 0.0, 'winddirection': 0.0, 'relativehumidity': 85.0, 'icing': False, \"mission\": { \"missionspeed\": 10.0 }, 'timestep': 1, 'xlabel': 'missionspeed', 'ylabel': 'alpha', 'title': 'Stolaroff', 'simulationtype': 'simple', 'model': 'abdilla', 'xvals': [0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,8.0,9.0,10.0,11.0,12.0,13.0,14.0,15.0], 'validation': False, 'validationcase': 'Stolaroff2018', 'batterytechnology': 'current' } } Assumed Specs Some specifications are not explicitly available, or require some adaptation at runtime. Note that the 'altitude' setting of validation cases is not always known and is set by default to '0' . 'length' , 'width' , and 'height' parameters are not necessarily set to geometrically accurate values; rather, they are set so that 'length' times 'width' results in the top area and that 'width' times 'height' results in the drone's frontal area. 'L/D' and 'propulsiveefficiency' When simulating a fixed-wing drone, the current model requires input parameters for the lift-to-drag ratio ( 'L/D' ) and the efficiency of the propulsive system ( 'propulsiveefficiency' ). Ballpark estimates for small UAVs are on the order of 10 and 30%, respectively, although these values heavily depend on the specific geometries and propulsive systems of the drones. Battery parameters 'batterytechnology' 'batterytechnology' must be set to one of the following options: 'current' , 'near-future' , or 'far-future' . 'current' will use the current battery capacity as specified in drone.params . 'near-future' projects a future capacity in five years based on an increase of 3.5% of battery capacity each year. 'far-future' projects battery capacity for lithium-air batteries, about ten times the capacity of current LiPo batteries. 'stateofhealth' and 'stateofcharge' 'stateofhealth' refers to the amount of capacity contained within the battery relative to its initial capacity at first use. 100% would be a new battery. LiPo batteries (most commonly used battery for drones) are typically retired when their state of health falls to 80-85%. At lower states of health, the battery capacity is decreased and cycles through a full charge more quickly. 'stateofcharge' refers to the current capacity level of the battery, where 100% is fully charged (regardless of how much the battery has been used before), and 0% is a dead battery. Weather parameters 'dropsize' , 'liquidwatercontent' and 'rainfallrate' These parameters specifiy rain characteristics. If there is no rain in the simulation, set these to 0.0. 'dropsize' refers to the diameter of a raindrop (assuming a spherical shape), with units of meters. 'liquidwatercontent' refers to the amount of water in a given volume of air, with units of kg/m^3. 'rainfallrate' is the rate of rainfall in units of mm/hr, which translates to litres per cubic meter per hour. Only one of 'liquidatercontent' and 'rainfallrate' needs to be specified. 'temperature' Units of temperature are given in degrees Celcius. 'relativehumidity' 'relativehumidity' refers to water content in the air, ranging from 0% to 100%. Mission parameters 'mission' is a dictionary with the following keys: 'missionspeed' \u2014 the cruise velocity of the drone, with units of m/s. 'altitude' \u2014 in units of meters. 'heading' \u2014 the heading angle of the drone, in units of _ ____. 'payload' \u2014 the mass of any exra payload attached to the drone (e.g., camera), in units of kg. Plotting parameters 'xlabel' and 'ylabel' not only specify axis labels of the plot, but also tell the simulation what to solve for ( 'ylabel' ) and what parameter to loop through ( 'xlabel' ). 'ylabel' can be range , endurance , or power . 'xlabel' can be any variable from the following list: \"startstateofcharge\", \"altitude\", \"temperature\", \"dropsize\", \"liquidwatercontent\", \"newtemperature\", \"windspeed\", \"winddirection\", \"relativehumidity\", \"payload\", \"missionspeed\" 'xvals' is a list containing all the values of x the simulation will loop through and produce a single data point for. 'zlabel' can be specified to any of the variables used for the 'xlabel' parameter (see list above) to loop through. This will produce a curve for each of the values in 'zvals' and plot them on the same figure. This is useful for looping through a weather effect, such as temperature or relative humidity, to see their effects on a plot of range vs payload. 'title' is the title displayed on the top of the plot, followed by the current date. Currently, the title needs to be one word. A title of multiple words can have each word separated by an underscore en lieu of a space. Theory Drone AWE is intended to predict performance parameters of rotary and fixed-wing drones based on readily-available specifications. To accomplish this, the power requirements for a given flight maneuver is calculated and used to predict battery drain behavior. Then, parameters such as range and endurance can be calculated. Comprehensive state data is collected at each step of a simulation, providing a versatile data set as output for study. Power Rotary Drones For rotary drones, power consumption is predicted in two steps. First, model parameters are calibrated based on known specifications, like maximum hover time and rotor diameter. Then, momentum theory is used to predict the power consumption. Calibration Momentum Theory According to rotor momentum theory, five equations govern the flight of a rotorcraft: $T = \\sqrt{W^2 + D^2}$ $tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{D}{W}$ $D = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V_\\infty^2 C_D A_{\\bot}$ $v_i = \\frac{T}{2 A_{rotor} N_{rotor} \\rho \\sqrt{V_\\infty^2 cos^2(\\alpha) + (V_\\infty sin(\\alpha) + v_i^2)}}$ $A_{\\bot} = A_{front} cos(\\alpha) + A_{top} sin(\\alpha)$ A modified set of these equations were applied to rotary drones by Stolaroff, Samaras, O'Neill et. al. in [1]. Drone AWE predicts the power consumption of a rotary drone by solving this system. GEKKO, a software package introduced in [2], is used to solve for: $T$ - thrust per rotor $\\alpha$ - angle of attack $D$ - drag $v_i$ - rotor induced velocity $A_{\\bot}$ - planform area of the drone perpendicular to its velocity given the following: $W$ - effective weight $V_\\infty$ - drone speed $C_D$ - drag coefficient $A_{rotor}$ - rotor area $N_{rotor}$ - number of rotors $\\rho$ - air density $A_{front}$ - frontal drone area $A_{top}$ - drone top area Note that the model currently assumes that the drag coefficient does not change with velocity and/or angle of attack. The power requirement for the hover case is calculated according to another equation from [1]: $P_{hover} = \\frac{W^{3/2}}{\\eta \\sqrt{2N_{rotor} A_{rotor} \\rho}}$ where $\\eta$ is the propulsive efficiency calculated as: $\\eta = \\frac{P_{hover}}{P_{hover, actual}} where $P_{hover, actual}$ is predicted using: $P_{hover, actual} = \\frac{CV_{battery}}{E_{hover}}$ where $C$ is the battery capacity, $V_{battery}$ is the battery voltage, and $t_{hover}$ is the hover endurance of the drone. Ideally, each parameter is available as published specifications for the drone to be modeled. Next, $\\eta$ is used to predict power consumption for the non-hover case as: $P = \\eta T(V_\\infty sin(\\alpha) + v_i)$ Fixed-Wing Drones Range and Endurance Endurance is defined as the length of time a drone can remain airborne. Range is the physical distance traveled by the drone. Endurance is calculated by dividing the battery energy (capacity multiplied by voltage) by the power required: $t = \\frac{C\\times V}{P}$ where $t$ is the endurance, $C$ is the battery capacity, and $V$ is the average battery voltage. Range is then simply calculated by multiplying the endurance by the average velocity of the drone: $R = t\\times U$ where $R$ is the range in meters and $U$ is the average drone velocity. Weather Temperature From the ideal gas law, $PV=nRT$ (which applies to standard air conditions), temperature is inversely proportional to air density: $T \\propto \\frac{1}{\\rho}$ In this model the increase or decrease in temperature is taken from 15 \u00b0C, and is used to calculate an associated change in air density. In turn, density directly influences power required for drones. Humidity Humidity also has a direct impact on air density, which directly affects power requirements for drones. This model uses empirical data obtained from [3], where the effects of varying levels of humidity and temperature on air density were recorded. Rain Rain has many effects on the flight performance of drones; however, there is little to no information or validation experiments that test the effects of rain on rotary-wing drones. Thus, for rotary drones in this model, only the effects of downward momentum imparted by the rain to the drone is considered. It is not meant to be comprehensive and, with the aid of more empirical data, could be refined and/or altered significantly to better represent the effects of rain. For fixed-wing drones, in addition to the momentum exchange, rain has been shown to both decrease lift and increase drag at all practical angles of attack. In this model, a slight reduction in the lift-to-drag ratio is performed, based on averages taken from plots from [4] and [5] (the lift coefficient is reduced by 6% and the drag coefficient increases by 0.01). Force from downward momentum was calculated from the droplet size and liquid water content, as specified by the user. If a rainfall rate was instead given, the following conversion is performed taken from [4]: $Drizzle:\\ LWC = \\frac{30000\\pi10^{-3}}{5.7^4R^{-0.84}}$ $Widespread:\\ LWC = \\frac{7000\\pi10^{-3}}{4.1^4R^{-0.84}}$ $Thunderstorm:\\ LWC = \\frac{1400\\pi10^{-3}}{5.7^4R^{-0.84}}$ where $LWC$ is the liquid water content in $g/m^3$ and $R$ is the rainfall rate in mm/hr. Drizzle, widespread, and thunderstorm rain conditions were determined based on the value of $R$. The force from a single droplet is found by multiplying the droplet mass by the change in velocity of the droplet upon impact ($\\Delta V$). Assuming each drop is a sphere of diameter 'dropsize' , the terminal velocity can be calculated as: $Terminal\\ velocity\\ V_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mg}{C_d\\rho A}}$ where $m$ is the droplet mass, $g$ is accelleration due to gravity, $C_d$ is the coefficient of drag (in this case assumed to be 0.5), $\\rho$ is the density of air, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the droplet. This equation can be derived from setting equal the forces of gravity and drag on the raindrop. Upon impact with a drone's surface, some or all of the drop can stick to the surface or splash back. Criteron given in [4] determines this outcome based on the droplet's weber number: $We = \\frac{\\rho_{air} V_t^2 d}{\\sigma}$ where $d$ is the droplet diameter, $V_t$ is the drop's velocity, and $\\sigma$ is the water surface tension (this is taken from empirical values based on the current temperature). The result of the drop's impact is assumed to be: $We < 5$: drop sticks; $\\Delta V = V_t$ $5 < We < 10$: drop rebounds; $\\Delta V = 2V_t$ $10 < We < 18.0^2 D_p(\\rho_{drop}/\\sigma)^{1/2}V_t^{1/4}f^{3/4}$: drop spreads; $\\Delta V = V_t$ $18.0^2 D_p(\\rho_{drop}/\\sigma)^{1/2}V_t^{1/4}f^{3/4} < We$: drop splashes; $\\Delta V = V_t(1+2/\\pi)$ The number of raindrops incident on the drone per second ($f$) can be determined by dividing the liquid water content (with units of kg/m^3) by the droplet mass, and then multiplying by the drone area and the velocity of the drops: $#\\ of\\ drops\\ incident\\ per\\ second\\ f = \\frac{LWC A_{drone} U_{drop}}{m_{drop}}$ Putting all of this together, the force imparted by all incident raindrops per second on a drone is the number of incident drops multiplied by the change in momentum, the average droplet mass multiplied by the average change in velocity: $F = f * (m_{drop} \\times \\Delta V)$ This force acts in the opposite direction of lift, which requires more power to overcome. It effectively increases the \"weight\" of the drone as far as power generation is concerned. Wind Icing Ice accretion has many adverse effects on a drone's flight performance, including significant losses in lift and increases in drag. In addition, ice adds more weight to the system, which is especially significant for drones, whose weights are small to begin with. Icing effects can even lead to premature stall conditions. Despite these dangerous risks, icing is also very difficult to predict without using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is outside the current scope of this project. In this model, we do not attempt to predict the effects of icing; however, at certain conditions we do issue a warning to the user that icing could occur at those operating conditions, specifically when temperature is low and humidity is high. We encourage users to refer to the icing sections in our literature reviews of weather effects on drone flight performance for more information. Units Properties and their respective units are converted within the simulation to SI units, and then converted back. Those units are: Electricity Capacity: milliamp-hours [mAh] Voltage: volts [V] Current: amperes [A] Resistance: ohms [\u03a9] Mechanics Velocity/Speed: meters per second [m/s] Power: watts [W] Endurance or Flight time: minutes [min] Altitude: meters [m] mass: kilograms [kg] note that \"takeoff weight\" is measured in mass units Miscellaneous Temperature: degrees Celcius [\u00b0C] Wind Resistance: meters per second [m/s] *refers to the maximum wind speed rating for the drone Battery re-charge time: minutes [min] functions.py \u2014 Commonly used functions getparams reads in a .txt or .csv file and outputs a dictionary with keys from a specified list and values from the specified parameter file. getXandY() reads in data from a validation case and saves the contents to lists for x and y. This function assumes the first row contains labels and ignores them. interpolate() does a simple linear interpolation with inputs of 2 x-values, 2 y-values, and the x-value of the interpolated value.

Drone AWE predicts the power consumption of a rotary drone by solving this system. GEKKO, a software package introduced in [2], is used to solve for: $T$ - thrust per rotor $\\alpha$ - angle of attack $D$ - drag $v_i$ - rotor induced velocity $A_{\\bot}$ - planform area of the drone perpendicular to its velocity given the following: $W$ - effective weight $V_\\infty$ - drone speed $C_D$ - drag coefficient $A_{rotor}$ - rotor area $N_{rotor}$ - number of rotors $\\rho$ - air density $A_{front}$ - frontal drone area $A_{top}$ - drone top area Note that the model currently assumes that the drag coefficient does not change with velocity and/or angle of attack.

This model uses empirical data obtained from [3], where the effects of varying levels of humidity and temperature on air density were recorded.","title":"Humidity"},{"location":"#rain","text":"Rain has many effects on the flight performance of drones; however, there is little to no information or validation experiments that test the effects of rain on rotary-wing drones. Thus, for rotary drones in this model, only the effects of downward momentum imparted by the rain to the drone is considered. It is not meant to be comprehensive and, with the aid of more empirical data, could be refined and/or altered significantly to better represent the effects of rain. For fixed-wing drones, in addition to the momentum exchange, rain has been shown to both decrease lift and increase drag at all practical angles of attack. In this model, a slight reduction in the lift-to-drag ratio is performed, based on averages taken from plots from [4] and [5] (the lift coefficient is reduced by 6% and the drag coefficient increases by 0.01). Force from downward momentum was calculated from the droplet size and liquid water content, as specified by the user. If a rainfall rate was instead given, the following conversion is performed taken from [4]: $Drizzle:\\ LWC = \\frac{30000\\pi10^{-3}}{5.7^4R^{-0.84}}$ $Widespread:\\ LWC = \\frac{7000\\pi10^{-3}}{4.1^4R^{-0.84}}$ $Thunderstorm:\\ LWC = \\frac{1400\\pi10^{-3}}{5.7^4R^{-0.84}}$ where $LWC$ is the liquid water content in $g/m^3$ and $R$ is the rainfall rate in mm/hr. Drizzle, widespread, and thunderstorm rain conditions were determined based on the value of $R$. The force from a single droplet is found by multiplying the droplet mass by the change in velocity of the droplet upon impact ($\\Delta V$). Assuming each drop is a sphere of diameter 'dropsize' , the terminal velocity can be calculated as: $Terminal\\ velocity\\ V_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mg}{C_d\\rho A}}$ where $m$ is the droplet mass, $g$ is accelleration due to gravity, $C_d$ is the coefficient of drag (in this case assumed to be 0.5), $\\rho$ is the density of air, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area of the droplet. This equation can be derived from setting equal the forces of gravity and drag on the raindrop. Upon impact with a drone's surface, some or all of the drop can stick to the surface or splash back. Criteron given in [4] determines this outcome based on the droplet's weber number: $We = \\frac{\\rho_{air} V_t^2 d}{\\sigma}$ where $d$ is the droplet diameter, $V_t$ is the drop's velocity, and $\\sigma$ is the water surface tension (this is taken from empirical values based on the current temperature). The result of the drop's impact is assumed to be: $We < 5$: drop sticks; $\\Delta V = V_t$ $5 < We < 10$: drop rebounds; $\\Delta V = 2V_t$ $10 < We < 18.0^2 D_p(\\rho_{drop}/\\sigma)^{1/2}V_t^{1/4}f^{3/4}$: drop spreads; $\\Delta V = V_t$ $18.0^2 D_p(\\rho_{drop}/\\sigma)^{1/2}V_t^{1/4}f^{3/4} < We$: drop splashes; $\\Delta V = V_t(1+2/\\pi)$ The number of raindrops incident on the drone per second ($f$) can be determined by dividing the liquid water content (with units of kg/m^3) by the droplet mass, and then multiplying by the drone area and the velocity of the drops: $#\\ of\\ drops\\ incident\\ per\\ second\\ f = \\frac{LWC A_{drone} U_{drop}}{m_{drop}}$ Putting all of this together, the force imparted by all incident raindrops per second on a drone is the number of incident drops multiplied by the change in momentum, the average droplet mass multiplied by the average change in velocity: $F = f * (m_{drop} \\times \\Delta V)$ This force acts in the opposite direction of lift, which requires more power to overcome. It effectively increases the \"weight\" of the drone as far as power generation is concerned.","title":"Rain"},{"location":"#wind","text":"","title":"Wind"},{"location":"#icing","text":"Ice accretion has many adverse effects on a drone's flight performance, including significant losses in lift and increases in drag.

Despite these dangerous risks, icing is also very difficult to predict without using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is outside the current scope of this project. In this model, we do not attempt to predict the effects of icing; however, at certain conditions we do issue a warning to the user that icing could occur at those operating conditions, specifically when temperature is low and humidity is high.
